2. **POWER BI DASHBOARD**  - ON CAFE REWARDS OFFER

Link to the data - [Cafe+Rewards+Offers.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/20550449/Cafe%2BRewards%2BOffers.zip)

Details about the data - Data that simulates the behavior of Cafe Rewards members over a 30-day period, including their transactions and responses to promotional offers.

Customers receive offers once every few days and have a limited time to redeem them. These can be informational offers (simple advertisement of a product), discount offers, or "buy one, get one" (BOGO) offers. Each customer receives a different mix of offers, attempting to maximize their probability of making a purchase.

Every customer purchase during the period is marked as a transaction. For a transaction to be attributed to an offer, it must occur at the same time as when the offer was "completed" by the customer.

Recommended Analysis
1. How many reward offers were completed? Which offers had the highest completion rate?

2. How many informational offers were followed by transactions?

3. How are customer demographics distributed?

4. Are there any demographic patterns in offer completion?
